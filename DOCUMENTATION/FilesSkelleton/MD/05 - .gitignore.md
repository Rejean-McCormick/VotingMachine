```gitignore
Pre-Coding Essentials (Component: .gitignore, Version/FormulaID: VM-ENGINE v0) — 5/89
1) Goal & Success
Goal: Ignore build artifacts, caches, and local/IDE noise while tracking all normative inputs (schemas, fixtures, vendor).
Success: git status shows only source/doc/spec changes; no accidental commits of target/, artifacts/, UI build output, or OS clutter.
2) Scope
In scope: workspace-wide ignore rules for Rust, Tauri UI, CI artifacts, OS/IDE files.
Out of scope: line-ending normalization (.gitattributes), editor formatting (.editorconfig).
3) Inputs → Outputs
Inputs: Cargo workspace, Tauri UI subproject, Makefile output locations.
Outputs: Clean VCS state; reproducible clones (no missing required files like vendor/, schemas/, fixtures/).
4) Entities/Tables
5) Variables
6) Functions
(None.)
7) Algorithm Outline (rules to include)
Add the following patterns, in this order (specific → generic), with comments:
gitignore
CopyEdit
# --- Rust / Cargo ---
/target/
/**/target/
**/*.rs.bk

# Coverage / profiling (if used)
*.profraw
*.gcda
*.gcno
*.lcov

# --- Workspace artifacts (transient) ---
/artifacts/
/dist/
/tmp/
/.cache/

# --- Tauri (Rust side) ---
/crates/vm_app/src-tauri/target/
/crates/vm_app/src-tauri/.tauri-build
/crates/vm_app/src-tauri/.cargo-lock-backup

# --- Frontend (Vite/Node) ---
/crates/vm_app/ui/node_modules/
/crates/vm_app/ui/.vite/
/crates/vm_app/ui/dist/
/crates/vm_app/ui/npm-debug.log*
/crates/vm_app/ui/yarn-error.log*
/crates/vm_app/ui/pnpm-lock.yaml # keep lock if you decide to pin; otherwise ignore

# --- OS / editors ---
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
Desktop.ini
*.log
*.tmp
*.bak
*~
*.swp
*.swo
.idea/
.vscode/

# --- Test run byproducts (safety) ---
**/*.assert.out
**/*.assert.err

# --- DO NOT IGNORE (must be tracked) ---
# (Documentation comments only; no patterns needed.)
# - vendor/            (keep for offline builds)
# - schemas/           (normative JSON Schemas)
# - fixtures/          (Annex B test data)
# - crates/vm_app/ui/public/map/tiles/*.mbtiles (bundled tiles)

8) State Flow
Developers run builds/tests → outputs land in ignored folders → repo stays clean.
9) Determinism & Numeric Rules
N/A (supports determinism by ensuring canonical inputs are versioned and transient outputs are not).
10) Edge Cases & Failure Policy
If you later vendor dependencies, ensure vendor/ is not ignored (leave as tracked).
If CI needs to diff generated reports, write them outside artifacts/ or temporarily remove that rule in CI-only .gitignore overrides.
Keep lockfiles (Cargo.lock, UI lockfile if chosen) tracked for reproducibility.
11) Test Checklist (must pass)
Fresh clone + make ci → git status clean.
Create dummy files in each ignored dir → git status still clean.
Verify schemas/, fixtures/, vendor/ remain unignored (e.g., add a file and see it appear in git status).
```
